 *
 * A binary heap is a heap data structure created using a binary tree. Binary tree has two rules â€“
 * 1) Binary Heap has to be complete binary tree at all levels except the last level. This is called shape property.
 * 2) All nodes are either greater than equal to (Max-Heap) or less than equal to (Min-Heap) to each of its child nodes.
 * This is called heap property. Implementation:
 *
 * 1) Use array to store the data.
 * 2) Start storing from index 1, not 0.
 * 3) For any given node at position i:
 * 4) Its Left Child is at [2*i] if available.
 * 5) Its Right Child is at [2*i+1] if available.
 * 6) Its Parent Node is at [i/2] if available.
