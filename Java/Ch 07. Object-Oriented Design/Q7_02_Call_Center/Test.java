/**
 * Call center: imagine you have a call center with 3 levels of employees: respondent, manager, director. an incoming
 * telephone call must ge first allocated to a respondent who is free. if the respondent can't handle the call, he or
 * she must escalae the call to a manager. if the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be
 * escalated to a director. design the classes and data structures for this roblem. implement a method dispathCall()
 * which assigns a call to the first available employee.
 *
 * hint 363: before coding, make a list of objects you need and walk through the common algorithms. picture the code. do
 * you have everything you need?
