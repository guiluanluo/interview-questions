 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
 *
 * Algorithm
 *  // Sort an arr[] of size n
 *  insertionSort(arr, n)
 *  Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
 *    a) Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0â€¦i-1]
 *
 * Another Example: 12, 11, 13, 5, 6
 *
 * Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 5 (Size of input array)
 *  i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
 *      11, 12, 13, 5, 6
 *  i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13
 *      11, 12, 13, 5, 6
 *  i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
 *      5, 11, 12, 13, 6
 * i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
 *      5, 6, 11, 12, 13
